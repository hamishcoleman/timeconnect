Timeconnect is a perl script designed to repeatedly test for a tcp
connection to a remote host. It is intended to behave similarly to ping,
except that it requests a TCP socket instead of perfoming a straight ping.

For usage information, use timeconnect '--man'

Timeconnect started out as a simpler script for the first author, but
then transmogrified into a training vessel for the second author.
